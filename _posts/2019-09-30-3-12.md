title:  But We Do War Better

Went to Quaker Meeting yesterday. There’s a Meeting House a couple of blocks from the townhouse. Modest building, seven by Quaker standards: two stories high, four chandeliers, and one vase filled with marigolds at the center of the benches. About a dozen people, which means low energy and not a whole lot of speaking. Perfect.

Today, I met with Rolf. He and his ex, Debbie, Anna’s mom, are preparing for a memorial service here in Silver Spring, and they want me to create a slideshow for the reception area. Of course, I’m happy to do this, though I’m worried that I am overloading myself with projects. Not that this one would be the one to refuse. I sat and listened to him talk his way through a couple of beers, and he seemed in remarkably good shape for someone who has lost his one and only child. My guess is that sitting with me outside at a beer garden was likely a relief for him.

When I said, “I can’t imagine what you are going through,” he deflected it - as would I, were our positions reversed. 

Women, in my experience, are not like that. They lean toward one another in a moment such as that and find support. They share their pain and lighten it. I haven’t a clue how they do such a thing. I don’t envy them, nor do I judge. I just watch in wonder, as though I am looking at art I do not understand.
