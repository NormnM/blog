title: The Witch
---
Yesterday was one of those classic Washington, DC summer days, with heat and humidity reaching the unbearable stage at 7:00 am and getting worse from there. Janette came back from PA around 7:30-ish and we had dinner that I had picked up from a local Thai place, partly because we could, and partly because I’ve done a pretty efficient job of emptying the refrigerator in preparation for there being no one here for a month.

We drank a bottle of wine while we ate and then caught up on late night comedy via YouTube, dragging ourselves to bed around 10:30. From time to time I have nightmares, and will wake myself up yelling this or that - just as my father did. For the past couple of years though, I’ve had nightmares - they come about every 6 months or so - with a central theme, which is the presence of a witch.

I never see the witch, and it feels to me a lot like The Blair Witch Project, in that there is a presence, and I know it’s of a witch, and I am absolutely terrified of her. Usually to the point of immobility. I’ve had this kind of dream for the past three or four nightmares, so dating back a couple of years, and they are all pretty regular variations on the first one, in which I was in my father’s office building, the place where he grew up, and I can feel her presence somewhere on the second floor. I go from room to room and her presence gets stronger, and eventually, in one of the dreams, I find a secret entrance to her apartment, which exists kind of between floors. I enter, terrified, but she’s not there. Just a lingering sense of her.

Last night I was walking with someone and we walked by her house, and we told one another not to look at it, not to let her see us (in that wonderfully schoolchild way of, if I can’t see her, she can’t see me) and then, having retrieved whatever it was we were after, re-traced our steps and headed home. Home, it turned out, was a house that stood in the place of the home I grew up in, and my companion peeled off to his or her house next door, When I approached my house, I saw that the siding of the first floor had been ripped off, along with part of the second floor. I walked inside and there, sitting at a table, sat the witch. I sat across from her and faced her for the first time. 

I told her to get out of my house, that she had no right to be there. She said nothing, but glared at me with barely concealed anger. I withdrew my arm from the table, believing she was intending to scratch it with razors. She stood up and began to walk around the table toward me, so I also stood and walked away, keeping the table between us and repeating, over and over, Get out of my house, You have no right to be here.

The words of course were spoken in a sort of slow motion yell, the kind of thing that happens in dreams where you are walking or running but your body is too difficult to move. I woke myself up that way, yelling “You have no right!” into the pillow.

I turned over hoping I had not woken Janette, but she was long gone. We never sleep the entire night together anymore, as my snoring/apnea/tossing keep her awake, so she usually comes to bed with me and then leaves the first time she wakes up. When we get to PA, we’ll just have separate bedrooms and be done with it. But now I was alone, and as I sat up in the middle of the night catching my breath and coming back to reality, I realized that the witch I had finally seen had been my mother.

Well, maybe 90-95% my mother. The rest seemed to be Joni Mitchell.
