title:  Day 2

At 2:00 am, Max arrives from Hawaii. In addition to a blistering sunburn on his back, he’s got a heart-shaped earring in his right lobe, and a tattoo reminiscent of his mother’s on his ankle, just where she had two dancing skeletons. We hug and it feels deeply satisfying to feel his slender presence in my arms. We chat a bit; he and Sam are sharing a double bed just a foot or so away from mine, and the three of us drift off to sleep.  I try hard not to get sentimental and picture them as children in their bunk beds, but this is what soothes me to sleep. 

They both seem on spiritual quests. From our study of pendulums, this is to be expected: I brought them up with an awareness of religion and philosophy but without prescription. They have planned a trip to India and Nepal after Eli and I leave them in Beijing. Earlier, Sam told me that toward the end of this year he plans to travel back to the States by way of Europe, coming back home for the holidays before moving in with Peifen in December or January. I offer him relationship advice that he does not ask for, and it sounds sober and practical and completely inappropriate to my own ears. 

I awake at 5:30, wait 45 minutes and then go looking for coffee. Nothing is open and I’ve forgotten my wallet anyway. I return to the room, listen to my children’s deep breathing and try to meditate but my mind is scattered and electric and it’s mostly unsatisfying. Starbucks opens at 7:30 and I buy black coffee and sit in the refrigerated basement space, listening to American music and watching Asians work their phones. One older gentleman, with a fountain pen tucked into the pocket of his white dress shirt and a neat head of gray hair with a matching mustache reads a paper. I wonder what he does for a living, who his wife is and what their tender moments are like. How often do they have them still? Do they have children? Are those children sources of happiness for them? Is he worried about retirement? Does he even still like his job?

Sam and I touched on this topic last night, as we watched one stream of people leaving the Kowloon ferry as another stream entered it, the ferry itself on an endless errand between the island and mainland. “Every one of those individuals,” Sam said, “has a life as full and rich as your own. There’s a word for that, I think.”

“I don’t know,” I say. “But if there is, it’s probably German.”

My kids, I think now, have so much ahead of them. Rich in so many ways, I think I’ll go wake them up.
