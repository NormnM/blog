At dinner, over hot pot again, somewhere in the conversation, Eli suggests a game to see who can write the largest number.

“But that’s simple,” Max says. “I could just start writing a bunch of zeroes.”

“Oh,” Eli responds. “But that is so inefficient! I mean, I don’t mean to brag, but I could so totally destroy you.”

I don’t mean to brag. I love that boy.
