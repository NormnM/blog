title: It's All in My Head
---
Watching television one night and I turn on an interview with Noam Chomsky. He is discussing the media, and I find fascinating what he has to say. Janette is completely turned off. “What good is what he is saying?” she asks. “It’s all in his head. There’s no emotion.”

Yes, exactly. Reading Chomsky is a retreat for me, a place I can go and not have to feel anything, except how smart he is and I, in turn, for appreciating him. Part of the pleasure of most dry, intellectual and to a large extent, boring reading is the respite from dealing with people, by which I mean engaging with them, by which I mean, of course, being open to the exchanges and vulnerabilities of emotion. That shit is exhausting.
