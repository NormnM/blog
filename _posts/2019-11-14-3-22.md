The last 3 nights I’ve had the house to myself. With all these things I have to do, you’d think I would have put the time to good use but no. I came home, made myself as much food as I could with the minimum of effort which means, the minimum number of buttons I have to press on the microwave, then sank into the couch and watched Netflix. Or Amazon Prime, whichever had something interesting and short, since even with this low level of activity, I needed to keep it to a minimum. 

By the third night, I slept from 10:30 to 6:30 without waking up once. It felt like a visit to an art museum for my soul: refreshing, inspiring, re-energizing. Most nights these days I wake up and think not “where am I?” but “where is the bathroom?” Until the bathroom is finished in the townhouse, I have to walk down a long, straight flight of stairs to get to one. In the basement here I need to go up half a flight. Now that I’m back upstairs, it’s just down the hall. While I appreciate that this is not the worst problem anyone of the human race has had to face, I still wake up feeling unusually good on those rare mornings when I’ve had a good night’s sleep. Was this what it was like for my father?
