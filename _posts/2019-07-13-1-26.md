The roads in this part of Pennsylvania connect one small town with another, and in between they wind through rolling farmland and horse country. It’s the edge of Amish territory, and it’s not uncommon to pass them in their horse-drawn buggies. We rode a few hours before sunset, looking from side to side upon ripening fields, their repeating rows of beige, feathery tops exposed to the sunlight which warmed them to a brilliant glow. Climbing hills, the bikes carried us gently up and over, with no more effort on our parts than a slight twist of our wrists. They cradled us in our seats with obedient strength and quiet vibration. As we dipped into hollows of shade, the air cooled to just this side of cold, and as we rose the sun warmed the air which hit our chests and washed our hands with a kind of motherly care. Returning to the cabin’s road, we slowed, side by side, to twenty-five miles an hour, the engines’ soft putter echoing off one another, and the contentment I felt was deep and true. It was also fleeting, but so, it seems, is everything.
