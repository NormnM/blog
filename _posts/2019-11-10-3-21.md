title:  Where I live
---
I saw an article that some sort of plague was discovered in China, and I immediately panicked because a few days prior, Sam had texted that he did not feel well. So I texted him back and of course he was just fine. He’s been travelling a lot lately: from Datong way up north to Wuhan to Xia’men to Shenzhen, so it’s likely he’s just exhausted.  Twelve hours of sleep, he said, took care of whatever bug he had. I love when my free-floating anxiety finds something to attach to and then that turns out just fine. Almost makes me feel like I live in reality and not in the dark well of all my fears.
