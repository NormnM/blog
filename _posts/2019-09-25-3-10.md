Got these replies from Sam and Max:

>Sam: I made an album of pictures of Merlin
>I know I have some even older ones but I'll have to dig them up later
>feel free to add

>Max: Love you all as well.
>Do not stand at my grave and weep;
>I am not there, I do not sleep.
>I am a thousand winds that blow.
>I am the diamond glints on snow.
>I am the sunlight on ripened grain.
>I am the gentle autumn rain.
>When you awaken in the morning's hush
>I am the swift uplifting rush
>Of quiet birds in circled flight.
>I am the soft stars that shine at night.
>Do not stand at my grave and cry;
>I am not there, I did not die.

>It's funny to think that our little snaggletoothed grouchler who snarled while he purred has gone on to join the infinite
>"I am the morning breakfasts touch
>I am the intermittent love
>I am in corners of the house
>I am in every gift of mouse"
>I have some pictures to add but they're all on my computer
>So I'll do it when I get home 

Nothing yet from Eli.
