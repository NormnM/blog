title: Bastille Day

Once, on a Bastille Day long ago, when I sat with my friend Gee in a cafe in Marseilles, he and I on a break from a semester of architectural grad school in Europe, made possible for me in part, by the generosity of Catholic University, I sat and watched a woman who stood before a house, along with a companion, in a tight-fitting and short dress with broad horizontal stripes, as she was approached by a man and, after a brief conversation, walked with the man to the rear of the house, only to reappear on the sidewalk in just a few minutes, re-joining her companion, the man nowhere to be seen. I said to Gee, “She must be very good to take care of him so quickly,” to which he replied, “Or, she took him to get rolled somewhere behind the house.” 

My naiveté can shock me at times.
