title:  Dogged Thoughts
---
I read recently in a book by Chögyam Trungpa in which he said, in essence, that to be incurious is to be shallow and dumb. And of course I carried that around for about a week, labelling myself as shallow and dumb because the truth is, I’m fairly incurious about most things. Certainly most people, anyway. And then today, during the long drive up to PA, I realized that for many of us, being incurious about the world outside of us is the best response to the world inside of us, which requires an enormous effort to simply keep under control. Our thoughts and feelings are like dogs in the kitchen: take your eye off them for just a second and they’ll eat your food right off the counter.
