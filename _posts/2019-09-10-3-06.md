Got a text this morning from Janette.

>Good morning! Best wishes for an way day at work!

Me: 
>Good morning! Thank you for your good wishes. May you have an way day as well.

>I meant easy day, not way day. But that has a ring to it . . . . Have your way with your day.

>Sounds . . .  Sinful? Sexy? Erotic?
>Oh wait.
>I’m over 60 now.
>Sounds pleasant.

>Ha ha ha.
>You are funny.

Yes, I am. So over sixty, creaky-jointed, gray-bearded, hearing-impaired and waning-everything funny. I think I’ll laugh my way over to the wall and just smash my head into it.
